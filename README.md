# IPL-data-analysis-

This project analyzes the IPL (Indian Premier League)  match data, sourced from Kaggle. IPL is one of the most popular T20 cricket leagues globally, and this dataset provides valuable insights into the matches, teams, players, and outcomes .

The dataset used for this analysis contains detailed information about each IPL match, including season, city, date, teams, toss details, match outcome, and player of the match, among others. It is publicly available on Kaggle and can be found here.

I have used Jupyter , matplotlib and seaborn to analyse and make graphs and charts from the data .

I have attached some screenshot of the charts in this repository
